SYST 17796

Deliverable 1

DESCRIPTION:
Using the given base code which depicts a basic card game, form a group of up to 4 students from your section and review the base code provided. You will find that it depicts the building blocks of a card game. 
There are classes that represent the Cards, the selection of a “hand” and the framework for the playing of the game. As we move through the term you will slowly extend this code base and refactor the code into a card game of your choosing. 
This means any game that is played with cards is eligible for the project. 

Some ideas are:

Go Fish

War

Uno

Skip-Bo

Spot It

Blackjack

You can also choose a game that is not on the list. 
More advanced students can choose a game with more difficult logic. 
There is no graphical user interface required. 
After you have chosen your group and decided upon a game, complete the Team Contract provided in a separate document and integrate it into your submission. 
Next, create a Git repository for your project group and store the base code in your repository. 
It can either be a public repository OR you can get a student license for a private repository through GitHub. 
You must be willing to add your instructor as a viewer (read-only access) if you choose the private option. 
The information necessary to access the Git repository will be provided in the Design Document Template. 
Next, create the UML domain class diagram that correctly depicts the current code. 
Make sure you use a CASE tool such as Visual Paradigm. 

Note that the base code is similar to but not identical to the CardTrick code used in class.

Student Version

Finally, complete the Design Document Template for the current base code AND your chosen game and integrate it into your submission
